## Description
Clears the search bar when clicking exchange items on Path of Exile Trade Exchange if it contains text, so the user does not have to manually remove the contents of the search bar for the highlights to disappear.

## How it Works
This userscript clears the search bar on clicking an exchange item only if the search bar contains text. It utilizes plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation and triggers an 'input' event to clear the search bar.

## Installation
1. **Install a Userscript Manager**: Use a browser extension like Tampermonkey.
2. **Install the Script**: Add the script to your userscript manager by clicking on the [Install Link](https://github.com/D4Enjoyer/poe-exchange-searchbar-clearer/raw/main/poe-exchange-searchbar-clearer.user.js) or in any other way that you prefer.

## Usage
Once the userscript is installed:
- Navigate to the Path of Exile Trade Exchange.
- Input text into the search bar to highlight something.
- Select an exchange item. If the search bar contains text, it will be cleared automatically.
